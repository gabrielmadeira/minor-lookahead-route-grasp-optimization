# minor-lookahead-route-grasp-optimization

The purpose of this work was to use the meta-heuristic Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) to solve the Minor Lookahead Route problem.
This problem seeks to find in a complete graph a Hamiltonian cycle that minimizes the sum of the distances of the edges given a lookahead value, where the edges have distances greater than or equal to zero.

This code was developed for the Combinatorial Optimization course at [INF](https://inf.ufrgs.br)-[UFRGS](https://ufrgs.br).
